### Complete the following tasks using Python. Your code should be clean, efficient, and well-commented, demonstrating your ability to solve real-world problems and write production-quality code. Provide explanations for any complex logic you use.

## Task 1: Data Parsing and Aggregation
You are given a JSON file containing sales data for an e-commerce platform with the following format:


[
    {"product_id": "p001", "date": "2023-11-01", "quantity": 2, "price": 20.5},
    {"product_id": "p002", "date": "2023-11-01", "quantity": 1, "price": 50.0},
    ...
]
Each entry represents a sale, including:

product_id: Unique ID of the product
date: Date of the sale in YYYY-MM-DD format
quantity: Quantity sold
price: Price per unit
### 1. Compute Total Sales per Product
Write a function to parse this data and calculate the total revenue generated for each product. The output should be a 
dictionary with product_id as keys and total revenue as values.

### 2. Find the Best-Selling Product of the Month
Write a function to identify the product with the highest total revenue within a given month. Your function should take 
a list of sales records and the month (e.g., "2023-11") as input and return the product ID and revenue.

## Task 2: Algorithmic Problem – Array and String Manipulation
Given a list of strings, write a function to group all anagrams together. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by 
rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase.

For example:


input_list = ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]
Expected output:


[
    ["eat", "tea", "ate"],
    ["tan", "nat"],
    ["bat"]
]
Your function should return a list of lists, where each sublist contains anagrams grouped together.

## Task 3: Data Analysis – Stock Prices
Imagine you are given historical stock prices for a company, with the following format:


prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
Each element represents the stock price on a given day. Write a function to determine the maximum profit you could 
achieve by buying and selling the stock only once. Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

For the example above, the maximum profit would be 5, achieved by buying at 1 and selling at 6.

## Task 4: Recursive Problem – Binary Tree Traversal
Implement a function that performs a pre-order traversal of a binary tree. Given the root of a binary tree, your 
function should return a list of values in pre-order (i.e., root, left, right).

Define the TreeNode class as follows:


class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
Your function signature should be:


def preorder_traversal(root: TreeNode) -> list:
    pass
## Task 5: SQL-like Query in Python
You are given a list of dictionaries representing orders in a simplified format:


orders = [
    {"order_id": 1, "customer": "Alice", "total": 50, "status": "completed"},
    {"order_id": 2, "customer": "Bob", "total": 100, "status": "pending"},
    {"order_id": 3, "customer": "Alice", "total": 75, "status": "completed"},
    ...
]
### 1. Filter Orders by Status
Write a function that takes the orders list and a status string (e.g., "completed") and returns a list of orders that 
match the given status.

### 2. Calculate Total Revenue by Customer
Write a function that calculates and returns the total revenue generated by each customer. The output should be a 
dictionary with customer names as keys and their total revenue as values.

## Evaluation Criteria
### - Code Quality: Your code should be well-organized, modular, and easy to read.
### - Efficiency: Aim for optimal time and space complexity in your solutions, especially for tasks involving larger datasets.
### - Correctness: All edge cases should be handled appropriately.
