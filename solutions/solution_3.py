    Data Analysis â€“ Stock Prices:
    -----------------------------
    Imagine you are given historical stock prices for a company, with the following format:
    prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4] Each element represents the stock price on a given day. Write a function to determine the maximum profit you could achieve by buying and selling the stock only once. Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.
    For the example above, the maximum profit would be 5, achieved by buying at 1 and selling at 6.
